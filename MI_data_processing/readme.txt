Each session consists of 4 runs, and each run consists of 40 trials (20 Left and 20 Right).
Trigger values:

15 # start of the run
14 # cue shown
13 # screen turned into blank
12 # Left_ready
11 # Left_go
10 # Right_ready
 9 # Right_go

So, what we really care is the period after left_go and right_go (e.g., 4 s).
