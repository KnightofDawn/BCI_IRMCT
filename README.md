Data processing in brain-computer interface

Dong Liu, BUAA

The EEG recording system is based on g.USBamp-16 with LSL data acquisition. The code here is tested with python 2.7.10, 64 bit. 
Meanwhile, you can also rely on Matlab to accomplish all your analysis.

All the procedure:
1. data acquisition
2. preprocessing (spatial filter, spectral filter, epoching)
3. feature selection
4. classification
5. statistics

Other parts:
communication with external devices, e.g., humanoid robotics, exeskletions, wheelchair.
